# Visual Philosophy

> Every animation should be both **entertaining** AND help the viewer **understand the concept**.

## Effect Categories

### Ambient (Background/Mood)
Set tone without competing with content. Subtle particles, vignettes, shifting gradients.

### Text Effects (Emphasis/Reveal)
| Effect | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| Shiny text | Key term, first introduction |
| Glitch text | Errors, security, system failures |
| Blur reveal | Dramatic reveals, thesis moments |
| Gradient text | Titles, section headers |
| Typewriter | Commands, technical terms |

**Rule:** Emphasize 1-3 key terms per sentence max. If everything is special, nothing is.

### Data Effects (Numbers)
CountUp for impressive stats. Reserve for numbers that deserve emphasis. Pause after big numbers land.

### Transitions
Most should be cuts or fades. Save fancy transitions for section boundaries.

### Diagrams
Build piece by piece with narration. Never show a complete diagram all at once.

## Visual Density

| Density | Use For |
|---------|---------|
| Sparse (1-2 elements) | Opening, quotes, key moments |
| Medium (3-4) | Most explanations |
| Dense (5+) | Summaries, dashboards |

**Rule:** Complex ideas = simpler visuals. Simple ideas can have richer visuals.

## Color Psychology

| Color | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| Blue (#3B82F6) | Tech, code, trust |
| Purple (#8B5CF6) | AI, abstract, creative |
| Amber (#F59E0B) | Warnings, key insights |
| Green (#10B981) | Success, solutions |
| Red (#EF4444) | Errors, danger |
| Gold (#C9A227) | Historical, premium |

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Motion sickness** — too many things moving at once
2. **Christmas tree** — too many colors competing
3. **Effect soup** — effects because you can, not because they help
4. **Dead air** — static screen with voiceover (always have something moving)
5. **Distraction** — effect drawing attention from the key point

## The Test

Before shipping, ask:
1. Does this help explain the concept?
2. Is this interesting to look at?
3. Does it match the emotional tone?
4. Is the viewer's eye guided to the right place?
